Throughout the history of rebel sons
It's not poetry, the message is one
So many signs to open your eyes
Change your way of thinking, challange your dreams ...

I'm sad to say, sad is the truth
seems like no one listens, no body understands
How many songs, how many verses
to change you so you can see again

What needs to happen, how to make you see
that what matters is only what you do achieve
So don't wait for others to wipe your nose
The change will come when you make a move
