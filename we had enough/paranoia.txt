I'm never alone not inside my head
Who are all these people? Am I really dead?
I have tons of friends or none at all
I don't need you to say I'm not good at all

I'm just confused not sick or whacked
Don't feed me pills let me fix my act
Are you really there show me a sign
Prove me you're real I'll be just fine

Paranoia strike takes me away
I don't know what's real but I know you ain't

Have you heard of Alice in wonder land
I have a feeling that's where I'll blend
Perfect lie or a perfect sense
all of that or a nonsense

Walls are melting sky is falling
Describe the picture? Mind blowing
Take this cookie and you'll be done
but all your friends will be gone
