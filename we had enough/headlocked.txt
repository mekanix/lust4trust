In a mourning wide open eyes
I can see what's the price
Fuckin' liberty gonna rise
Humanity slowly dies

U can't hide
who U are
Story of the past
showes the way

Don't let them bring U down
Fuck'em stay on the ground
They'll get what they deserve
The rusted soul and devils curve

Face it like you know how
much U can take
Hey, wake up or it's all
over no room for same mistake

U'll disappear forever lost
U'll disappear for high cost
Get yourself a conclusion
Aren't U sick of this abusion...
