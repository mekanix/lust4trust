I'm sick of your lies
Your life is a dice
Wipe your crying eyes
and make some sacrifice

Why wearing a disguise
My patience slowly dies
I can listen no more cries
It's time for you to rise

Shut up
Get the fuck out
Shut up

I'm not your clown
I'd rather see you down
You think you wear the crown
But your fucking nose is brown

Why do you think
you can pull another trick
You fuckin' dick
You just make me sick
