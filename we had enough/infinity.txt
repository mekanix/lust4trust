I've got ideas
that make me insane.
Why don't they
disappear?

What if all I need
is inside of me?
What if I only have
my own infinity?

You can't see it with your eyes,
you have to see it in your mind.
Expand Universe!
Expand your mind!

So much energy
in emptiness of space.
So much to be
attracted to.

The oldest question
is what's bothering me:
"Is this all there is
to reality?"
