Anti gay, KKK, anti race
Reject all, accept our way
Muslim or terrorist, that all the same
Lock em and send em away

Hackers and pot heads should all be dead
And non-believers too
Despise all the slanted eyes, and red skins
Destroy everything that's not like me


(chorus)
Lead by example, not fear
'Cause that's what we need
Fulfill this lust of mine
Lust for Trust

Can you show me you're worthy, can you
show me you have no hate
Make this lust go away
Lust for Trust
