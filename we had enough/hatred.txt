Hatred is spreading through my veins
All borders are falling down
Should we prepare for new dance
Soon Serbia will be angry frown

The screams of the dying will haunt our children for many decades

Campaign contributions are nothing more than bribes
Pockets growing, fatter at the expense of all our lives

Hatred is among us
waiting its moment still
strike will be harsh
from irrelevant peal

Fool with the money on spree
Like power without control
Only damage you can see
trail of destruction on another soul
