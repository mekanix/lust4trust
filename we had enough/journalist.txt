Chace big headlines, you publicity whore
Famous men lifes are all you're going for
Don't use your brain blindly trust my choice
It won't couse you pain if you follow my voice

Write objective? Nah, I like selective
Form the collective mind of the subjectives
Truth, easily bent
My word is godsent, the only relevant

Have confidence
Say it to my face
Have confidence

Follow the form misinform
News patroll to retain controll
Of your dome, stay on the trone and
poison each home with the mind clone syndrome

Stay down, keep your head low
Now it's my time. Now I've got the ball.
I ain't the cream and I ain't machine
I hate regime it's time for redeem

Take it off this mind mold
Stop blinding me I won't do what I'm told
My soul is pure, I won't be sold
I'll regret nothing once I'm cold

So cut that bullshit, and tell me the news
Not some fabricated tale you choose
I want the truth and nothing else
I don't give a fuck whether it sells
