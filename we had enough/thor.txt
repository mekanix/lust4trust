Thor, God of thunder and lightning
One of the Asira
Save me, country from giants
Throwing snow and ice

Odin told us to keep door open
For the tiered travelers
To walk on path to the friend
As not to overgrown with weeds

Nine worlds,
Needled with the third world
Asgard, on top as my home

Roots of Yggdrasil
Reach to the holy ghosts
Where people rarely roam

The tree of human destiny
Bounded with me so strong
Spring of unborn souls
Midgard is your home

And in the kingdom of goddess of death
She is an ancestor of Loki
Where plate is starvation
And knife is a hunger

We, warriors, saved by Valkyries
Leaded by the Thor
On the day of Ragnarok
New world will be born

Don't be afraid
To fight to the new world
You have nothing to lose

Your arm is strong
To fight for the new world
Thor's hammer is by my side
