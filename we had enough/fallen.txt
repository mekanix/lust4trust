Look in to my eyes
That cut through the night
Through the pain, 'till you see the light

Look in to my eyes
They burn deep inside
For the power you'll have to bide

There so many people
That wants to drawn its life
Into something else

Look in to my soul
Is it pure, or is it not
Who can tell, but you know

Look in to my soul
Rise like ONE
You don't have to fall

So many years I have to wait
To see what Serbia has become
Where do we go, why on this path?
Do you still believe?'
