An unfinished thought
caught hanging in the air
Alone again
lights fade out, slowly

How could I ever think
how could I dare
She could be mine
so wild and lost in the other world

I could turn away
in a different direction
I could, well I could have done
a thousand other things

Just not that one
forbidden one

Alone again - I am
One more drink - just one

I'm leaving, home, forever
to find my peace
