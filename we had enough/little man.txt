Hey little man,
Don't you see you slowly dying?
Wake up, little man,
Your life is a misery
Every pain, you feel,
Feels the same as I do
Listen to my words,
You're guilty for the way you livin'

Fight Little Man
Turn to yourself, keep on fighting
Fight Little Man
Fight for better living
Fight Little Man
You are afraid, as I am
Fight Little Man
Today is good day to try


Hey little man,
Now is the time, your time
Find new path, find the light,
Find the strength within
Try little man,
To change the world around you
You know, my friend,
There's no other chance
